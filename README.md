*Have you ever wanted to port a Super Mario Maker 1 course to Super Mario Maker 2, but didn't want to go through all the trouble of placing every single block, item, and enemy?  Well it's your lucky day!*

# cdt2bcd
An extremely unfinished, experimental tool that converts data from a Super Mario Maker 1 course file to Super Mario Maker 2 format.  

WARNING: This will *NOT* work with porting Super Mario Maker 1 courses to Super Mario Maker 2 yet, as it's extremely early in it's development, and is nowhere near finished! It's mostly just for experimentation at this point, but I will be working to get this working fully!
